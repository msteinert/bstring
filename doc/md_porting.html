<div class="textblock"><p>by Paul Hsieh</p>
<p>The bstring library is an attempt to provide improved string processing functionality to the C and C++ language. At the heart of the bstring library is the management of <span class="tt">bstring</span>s which are a significant improvement over &lsquo;&rsquo;\0'` terminated char buffers. See the accompanying documenation for more information.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md42"></a>
Identifying the Compiler</h1>
<p>Bstrlib has been tested on the following compilers:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNU C/C++</li>
<li>Microsoft Visual C++</li>
<li>Watcom C/C++ (32 bit flat)</li>
<li>Intel's C/C++ compiler (on Windows)</li>
<li>The GNU C/C++ compiler (on Windows/Linux on x86 and PPC64)</li>
<li>Borland C++</li>
<li>Turbo C</li>
</ul>
<p>There are slight differences in these compilers which requires slight differences in the implementation of Bstrlib. These are accomodated in the same sources using <span class="tt">#ifdef/#if defined</span> on compiler specific macros. To port Bstrlib to a new compiler not listed above, it is recommended that the same strategy be followed. If you are unaware of the compiler specific identifying preprocessor macro for your compiler you might find it <a href="http://predef.sourceforge.net/precomp.html">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>Note: Intel C/C++ on Windows sets the Microsoft identifier: <span class="tt">_MSC_VER</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md43"></a>
16-bit vs. 32-bit vs. 64-bit Systems</h1>
<p>Bstrlib has been architected to deal with strings of length between <span class="tt">0</span> and <span class="tt">INT_MAX</span> (inclusive). Since the values of int are never higher than <span class="tt">size_t</span> there will be no issue here. Note that on most 64-bit systems <span class="tt">int</span> is 32-bit.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md44"></a>
Dependency on The C-Library</h1>
<p>Bstrlib uses the functions <span class="tt">memcpy</span>, <span class="tt">memmove</span>, <span class="tt">malloc</span>, <span class="tt">realloc</span>, <span class="tt">free</span> and <span class="tt">vsnprintf</span>. Many free standing C compiler implementations that have a mode in which the C library is not available will typically not include these functions which will make porting Bstrlib to it onerous. Bstrlib is not designed for such bare bones compiler environments. This usually includes compilers that target ROM environments.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md45"></a>
Porting Issues</h1>
<p>Bstrlib has been written completely in ANSI/ISO C and ISO C++, however, there are still a few porting issues. These are described below.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md46"></a>
Weak C++ Compiler</h2>
<p>C++ is a much more complicated language to implement than C. This has lead to varying quality of compiler implementations. The weaknesses isolated in the initial ports are inclusion of the Standard Template Library, <span class="tt">std::iostream</span> and exception handling. By default it is assumed that the C++ compiler supports all of these things correctly. If your compiler does not support one or more of these define the corresponding macro: </p><pre class="fragment">BSTRLIB_CANNOT_USE_STL
BSTRLIB_CANNOT_USE_IOSTREAM
BSTRLIB_DOESNT_THROW_EXCEPTIONS
</pre><p>The compiler specific detected macro should be defined at the top of bstrwrap.h in the Configuration defines section. Note that these disabling macros can be overrided with the associated enabling macro if a subsequent version of the compiler gains support. (For example, its possible to rig up STLport to provide STL support for WATCOM C/C++, so <span class="tt">-DBSTRLIB_CAN_USE_STL</span> can be passed in as a compiler option.)</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md47"></a>
Platform Specific Files</h1>
<p>The makefiles for the examples are basically setup of for particular environments for each platform. In general these makefiles are not portable and should be constructed as necessary from scratch for each platform.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md48"></a>
Testing a port</h1>
<p>To test that a port compiles correctly do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Run <span class="tt">make check</span> and ensure that no errors are reported.</li>
<li>Run <span class="tt">make memcheck</span> and ensure that no errors are reported.</li>
</ol>
<p>The builds must have zero errors and zero warnings. The result of execution should be essentially identical on each platform.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md49"></a>
Performance</h1>
<p>Different CPU and compilers have different capabilities in terms of performance. It is possible for Bstrlib to assume performance characteristics that a platform doesn't have (since it was primarily developed on just one platform). The goal of Bstrlib is to provide very good performance on all platforms regardless of this but without resorting to extreme measures (such as using assembly language, or non-portable intrinsics or library extensions).</p>
<p>There are two performance benchmarks that can be found in the <span class="tt">example</span> directory. They are: cbench.c and cppbench.cpp. These are variations and expansions of a benchmark for another string library. They don't cover all string functionality, but do include the most basic functions which will be common in most string manipulation kernels.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md50"></a>
