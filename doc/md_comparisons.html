<p>The bstring library is an attempt to provide improved string processing functionality to the C and C++ language. At the heart of the bstring library is the management of <span class="tt">bstring</span>s which are a significant improvement over &lsquo;&rsquo;\0'` terminated char buffers. See the accompanying documenation for more information.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md0"></a>
Comparison With Microsoft's CString Class</h1>
<p>The bstring library has significant advantages over CString:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p class="startli">Bstrlib is a C-library as well as a C++ library (using the C++ wrapper)</p>
<p class="startli">Thus it is compatible with more programming environments and available to a wider population of programmers.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The internal structure of a bstring is considered exposed</p>
<p class="startli">A single contiguous block of data can be cut into read-only pieces by simply creating headers, without allocating additional memory to create reference copies of each of these sub-strings.</p>
<p class="startli">In this way, using bstrings in a totally abstracted way becomes a choice rather than an imposition. Further this choice can be made differently at different layers of applications that use it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Static declaration support precludes the need for constructor invocation</p>
<p class="startli">Allows for static declarations of constant strings that has no additional constructor overhead.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Bstrlib is not attached to another library</p>
<p class="startli">Bstrlib is designed to be easily plugged into any other library collection, without dependencies on other libraries or paradigms (such as "MFC".)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The bstring library also comes with a few additional functions that are not available in the CString class:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="tt">bsetstr</span></li>
<li><span class="tt">bsplit</span></li>
<li><span class="tt">bread</span></li>
<li><span class="tt">breplace</span> (this is different from <span class="tt">CString::Replace()</span>)</li>
<li>Writable indexed characters (for example &lsquo;a[i]='x&rsquo;`)</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, although Microsoft did implement <span class="tt">mid</span>, <span class="tt">left</span> and <span class="tt">right</span> functional analogues (these are functions from GWBASIC) they seem to have forgotten that <span class="tt">mid</span> could be also used to write into the middle of a string. This functionality exists in Bstrlib with the <span class="tt">bsetstr</span> and <span class="tt">breplace</span> functions.</p>
<p>Among the disadvantages of Bstrlib is that there is no special support for localization or wide characters. Such things are considered beyond the scope of what bstrings are trying to deliver. CString essentially supports the older UCS-2 version of Unicode via <span class="tt">widechar_t</span> as an application-wide compile time switch.</p>
<p>CString's also use built-in mechanisms for ensuring thread safety under all situations. While this makes writing thread safe code that much easier, this built-in safety feature has a price &ndash; the inner loops of each CString method runs in its own critical section (grabbing and releasing a light weight mutex on every operation.) The usual way to decrease the impact of a critical section performance penalty is to amortize more operations per critical section. But since the implementation of CStrings is fixed as a one critical section per-operation cost, there is no way to leverage this common performance enhancing idea.</p>
<p>The search facilities in Bstrlib are comparable to those in MFC's CString class, though it is missing locale specific collation. But because Bstrlib is interoperable with C's char buffers, it will allow programmers to write their own string searching mechanism (such as Boyer-Moore), or be able to choose from a variety of available existing string searching libraries (such as those for regular expressions) without difficulty.</p>
<p>Microsoft used a very non-ANSI conforming trick in its implementation to allow <span class="tt">printf</span> to use the <span class="tt">s</span> specifier to output a <span class="tt">CString</span> correctly. This can be convenient, but it is inherently not portable. Microsoft's own documentation recommends casting, instead of relying on this feature.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
Comparison With C++'s <span class="tt">std::string</span></h1>
<p>This is the C++ language's STL based string class.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is no C implementation.</li>
<li>The <span class="tt">[]</span> operator is not bounds checked.</li>
<li>Missing a lot of useful functions like <span class="tt">printf</span>-like formatting.</li>
<li>Some sub-standard <span class="tt">std::string</span> implementations (SGI) are necessarily unsafe to use with multithreading.</li>
<li>Limited by STL's std::iostream which in turn is limited by ifstream which can only take input from files. (Compare to CBStream's API which can take abstracted input.)</li>
<li>Extremely uneven performance across implementations.</li>
</ol>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
Comparison With ISO C TR 24731 Proposal</h1>
<p>Following the ISO C99 standard, Microsoft has proposed a group of C library extensions which are supposedly "safer and more secure". This proposal is expected to be adopted by the ISO C standard which follows C99.</p>
<p>The proposal reveals itself to be very similar to Microsoft's "StrSafe" library. The functions are basically the same as other standard C library string functions except that destination parameters are paired with an additional length parameter of type <span class="tt">rsize_t</span>. <span class="tt">rsize_t</span> is the same as <span class="tt">size_t</span>, however, the range is checked to make sure its between <span class="tt">1</span> and <span class="tt">RSIZE_MAX</span>. Like Bstrlib, the functions perform a "parameter check". Unlike Bstrlib, when a parameter check fails, rather than simply outputing accumulatable error statuses, they call a user settable global error function handler, and upon return of control performs no (additional) detrimental action. The proposal covers basic string functions as well as a few non-reenterable functions (<span class="tt">asctime</span>, <span class="tt">ctime</span>, and <span class="tt">strtok</span>).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Still based solely on <span class="tt">char *</span> buffers (and therefore <span class="tt">strlen</span> and <span class="tt">strcat</span> is still O(n), and there are no faster <span class="tt">streq</span> comparison functions.)</li>
<li>No growable string semantics.</li>
<li>Requires manual buffer length synchronization in the source code.</li>
<li>No attempt to enhance functionality of the C library.</li>
<li>Introduces a new error scenario (strings exceeding <span class="tt">RSIZE_MAX</span> length).</li>
</ol>
<p>The hope is that by exposing the buffer length requirements there will be fewer buffer overrun errors. However, the error modes are really just transformed, rather than removed. The real problem of buffer overflows is that they all happen as a result of erroneous programming. So forcing programmers to manually deal with buffer limits, will make them more aware of the problem but doesn't remove the possibility of erroneous programming. So a programmer that erroneously mixes up the <span class="tt">rsize_t</span> parameters is no better off from a programmer that introduces potential buffer overflows through other more typical lapses. So at best this may reduce the rate of erroneous programming, rather than making any attempt at removing failure modes.</p>
<p>The error handler can discriminate between types of failures, but does not take into account any callsite context. So the problem is that the error is going to be manifest in a piece of code, but there is no pointer to that code. It would seem that passing in the call site <span class="tt">__FILE__</span>, <span class="tt">__LINE__</span> as parameters would be very useful, but the API clearly doesn't support such a thing (it would increase code bloat even more than the extra length parameter does, and would require macro tricks to implement).</p>
<p>The Bstrlib C API takes the position that error handling needs to be done at the callsite, and just tries to make it as painless as possible. Furthermore, error modes are removed by supporting auto-growing strings and aliasing. For capturing errors in more central code fragments, Bstrlib's C++ API uses exception handling extensively, which is superior to the leaf-only error handler approach.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
Comparison With Managed String Library CERT Proposal</h1>
<p>Robert Seacord at CERT has <a href="http://www.cert.org/secure-coding/managedstring.html">proposed a C string library</a> that he calls the "Managed String Library" for C. Like Bstrlib, it introduces a new type which is called a managed string. The structure of a managed string (<span class="tt">string_m</span>) is like a <span class="tt">struct tagbstring</span> but missing the length field. This internal structure is considered opaque. The length is, like the C standard library, always computed on the fly by searching for a terminating NUL on every operation that requires it. So it suffers from every performance problem that the C standard library suffers from. Interoperating with C string APIs (like <span class="tt">printf</span>, <span class="tt">fopen</span>, or anything else that takes a string parameter) requires copying to additionally allocating buffers that have to be manually freed &ndash; this makes this library probably slower and more cumbersome than any other string library in existence.</p>
<p>The library gives a fully populated error status as the return value of every string function. The hope is to be able to diagnose all problems specifically from the return code alone. Comparing this to Bstrlib, which aways returns one consistent error message, might make it seem that Bstrlib would be harder to debug; but this is not true. With Bstrlib, if an error occurs there is always enough information from just knowing there was an error and examining the parameters to deduce exactly what kind of error has happened. The managed string library thus gives up nested function calls while achieving little benefit, while Bstrlib does not.</p>
<p>One interesting feature that "managed strings" has is the idea of data sanitization via character set whitelisting. That is to say, a globally definable filter that makes any attempt to put invalid characters into strings lead to an error and not modify the string. The author gives the following example: </p><pre class="fragment">/* create valid char set */
if (retValue = strcreate_m(&amp;str1, "abc") ) {
  fprintf(
    stderr,
    "Error %d from strcreate_m.\n",
    retValue
  );
}
if (retValue = setcharset(str1)) {
  fprintf(
    stderr,
    "Error %d from  setcharset().\n",
    retValue
  );
}
if (retValue = strcreate_m(&amp;str1, "aabbccabc")) {
  fprintf(
    stderr,
    "Error %d from strcreate_m.\n",
    retValue
  );
}
/* create string with invalid char set */
if (retValue = strcreate_m(&amp;str1, "abbccdabc")) {
  fprintf(
    stderr,
    "Error %d from strcreate_m.\n",
    retValue
  );
}
</pre><p>Which we can compare with a more Bstrlib way of doing things: </p><pre class="fragment">bstring bCreateWithFilter (const char * cstr, const bstring filter) {
  bstring b = bfromcstr (cstr);
  if (BSTR_ERR != bninchr (b, filter) &amp;&amp; NULL != b) {
    fprintf (stderr, "Filter violation.\n");
    bdestroy (b);
    b = NULL;
  }
  return b;
}

struct tagbstring charFilter = bsStatic ("abc");
bstring str1 = bCreateWithFilter ("aabbccabc", &amp;charFilter);
bstring str2 = bCreateWithFilter ("aabbccdabc", &amp;charFilter);
</pre><p>The first thing we should notice is that with the Bstrlib approach you can have different filters for different strings if necessary. Furthermore, selecting a charset filter in the Managed String Library is uni-contextual. That is to say, there can only be one such filter active for the entire program, which means its usage is not well defined for intermediate library usage (a library that uses it will interfere with user code that uses it, and vice versa). It is also likely to be poorly defined in multi-threading environments.</p>
<p>There is also a question as to whether the data sanitization filter is checked on every operation, or just on creation operations. Since the charset can be set arbitrarily at run time, it might be set <em>after</em> some managed strings have been created. This would seem to imply that all functions should run this additional check every time if there is an attempt to enforce this. This would make things tremendously slow. On the other hand, if it is assumed that only creates and other operations that take <span class="tt">char *</span>s as input need be checked because the charset was only supposed to be called once at and before any other managed string was created, then one can see that its easy to cover Bstrlib with equivalent functionality via a few wrapper calls such as the example given above.</p>
<p>And finally we have to question the value of sanitation in the first place. For example, for httpd servers, there is generally a requirement that the URLs parsed have some form that avoids undesirable translation to local file system filenames or resources. The problem is that the way URLs can be encoded, it must be completely parsed and translated to know if it is using certain invalid character combinations. That is to say, merely filtering each character one at a time is not necessarily the right way to ensure that a string has safe contents.</p>
<p>In the article that describes this proposal, it is claimed that it fairly closely approximates the existing C API semantics. On this point we should compare this "closeness" with Bstrlib:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th></th><th>Bstrlib</th><th>Managed String Library</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Pointer arithmetic</td><td>Segment arithmetic</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Use in C Std lib</td><td>data, or bdata{e}</td><td>getstr_m(x,*) ... free(x)</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>String literals</td><td>bsStatic, bsStaticBlk</td><td>strcreate_m()</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Transparency</td><td>Complete</td><td>None</td></tr>
</table>
<p>It's pretty clear that the semantic mapping from C strings to Bstrlib is fairly straightforward, and that in general semantic capabilities are the same or superior in Bstrlib. On the other hand the Managed String Library is either missing semantics or changes things fairly significantly.</p>

Comparison With Annexia's c2lib Library</h1>
<p>This library is <a href="http://www.annexia.org/freeware/c2lib">available online</a>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Still based solely on <span class="tt">char *</span> buffers (and therefore <span class="tt">strlen</span> and <span class="tt">strcat</span> is still O(n), and there are no faster <span class="tt">streq</span> comparison functions.) Their suggestion that alternatives which wrap the string data type (such as bstring does) imposes a difficulty in interoperating with the C langauge's ordinary C string library is not founded.</li>
<li>Introduction of memory (and vector?) abstractions imposes a learning curve, and some kind of memory usage policy that is outside of the strings themselves (and therefore must be maintained by the developer.)</li>
<li>The API is massive, and filled with all sorts of trivial (<span class="tt">pjoin</span>) and controvertial (<span class="tt">pmatch</span> &ndash; regular expression are not sufficiently standardized, and there is a very large difference in performance between compiled and non-compiled, REs) functions. Bstrlib takes a decidely minimal approach &ndash; none of the functionality in c2lib is difficult or challenging to implement on top of Bstrlib (except the regex stuff, which is going to be difficult, and controvertial no matter what.)</li>
<li>Understanding why c2lib is the way it is pretty much requires a working knowledge of Perl. bstrlib requires only knowledge of the C string library while providing just a very select few worthwhile extras.</li>
<li>It is attached to a lot of cruft like a matrix math library (that doesn't include any functions for getting the determinant, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, the matrix inverse, test for singularity, test for orthogonality, a grahm schmit orthogonlization, LU decomposition... I mean why bother?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Convincing a development house to use c2lib is likely quite difficult. It introduces too much, while not being part of any kind of standards body. The code must therefore be trusted, or maintained by those that use it. While bstring offers nothing more on this front, since its so much smaller, covers far less in terms of scope, and will typically improve string performance, the barrier to usage should be much smaller.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
Comparison With stralloc/qmail</h1>
<p>More information about this library can be <a href="http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/stralloc.html">found</a> <a href="http://cr.yp.to/lib/stralloc.html">online</a>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Library is very very minimal. A little too minimal.</li>
<li>Untargetted source parameters are not declared const.</li>
<li>Slightly different expected emphasis (like <span class="tt">_cats</span> function which takes an ordinary C string char buffer as a parameter). It's clear that the remainder of the C string library is still required to perform more useful string operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <span class="tt">struct</span> declaration for their string header is essentially the same as that for bstring. But it's clear that this was a quickly written hack whose goals are clearly a subset of what Bstrlib supplies. For anyone who is served by <span class="tt">stralloc</span>, Bstrlib is complete substitute that just adds more functionality.</p>
<p><span class="tt">stralloc</span> actually uses the interesting policy that a NULL data pointer indicates an empty string. In this way, non-static empty strings can be declared without construction. This advantage is minimal, since static empty bstrings can be declared inline without construction, and if the string needs to be written to it should be constructed from an empty string (or its first initializer) in any event.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
wxString Class</h1>
<p>This is the string class used in the <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org/manuals/2.4.2/wx368.htm#wxstring">wxWindows project</a>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is no C implementation.</li>
<li>The memory management strategy is to allocate a bounded fixed amount of additional space on each resize, meaning that it does not have the <span class="tt">log2(n)</span> property that Bstrlib has (it will thrash very easily, cause massive fragmentation in common heap implementations, and can easily be a common source of performance problems).</li>
<li>The library uses a "copy on write" strategy, meaning that it has to deal with multithreading problems.</li>
</ol>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
Vstr</h1>
<p>This is a highly orthogonal C string library with an emphasis on networking/realtime programming. It can be found <a href="http://www.and.org/vstr/">online</a>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The convoluted internal structure does not contain a &lsquo;&rsquo;\0'<span class="tt"> </span>char *` compatible buffer, so interoperability with the C library a non-starter.</li>
<li>The API and implementation is very large (owing to its orthogonality) and can lead to difficulty in understanding its exact functionality.</li>
<li>An obvious dependency on gnu tools (confusing make configure step)</li>
<li>Uses a reference counting system, meaning that it is not likely to be thread safe.</li>
</ol>
<p>The implementation has an extreme emphasis on performance for nontrivial actions (adds, inserts and deletes are all constant or roughly O(#operations) time) following the "zero copy" principle. This trades off performance of trivial functions (character access, char buffer access/coersion, alias detection) which becomes significantly slower, as well as incremental accumulative costs for its searching/parsing functions. Whether or not Vstr wins any particular performance benchmark will depend a lot on the benchmark, but it should handily win on some, while losing dreadfully on others.</p>
<p>The learning curve for Vstr is very steep, and it doesn't come with any obvious way to build for Windows or other platforms without gnu tools. At least one mechanism (the iterator) introduces a new undefined scenario (writing to a Vstr while iterating through it.) Vstr has a very large footprint, and is very ambitious in its total functionality. Vstr has no C++ API.</p>
<p>Vstr usage requires context initialization via <span class="tt">vstr_init</span> which must be run in a thread-local context. Given the totally reference based architecture this means that sharing Vstrings across threads is not well defined, or at least not safe from race conditions. This API is clearly geared to the older standard of <span class="tt">fork</span> style multitasking in UNIX, and is not safely transportable to modern shared memory multithreading available in Linux and Windows. There is no portable external solution making the library thread safe (since it requires a mutex around each Vstr context &ndash; not each string.)</p>
<p>In the documentation for this library, a big deal is made of its self hosted <span class="tt">sprintf</span>-like function. This is an issue for older compilers that don't include <span class="tt">vsnprintf</span>, but also an issue because Vstr has a slow conversion to &lsquo;&rsquo;\0'<span class="tt"> terminated </span>char *<span class="tt"> mechanism. That is to say, using </span>s<span class="tt"> to format
data that originates from Vstr would be slow without some sort of native
function to do so. Bstrlib sidesteps the issue by relying on what
</span>snprintf<span class="tt">-like functionality does exist and having a high performance
conversion to a </span>char *<span class="tt"> compatible string so that </span>s` can be used directly.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
Str Library</h1>
<p>This is a fairly <a href="http://www.utilitycode.com/str/default.aspx">extensive string library</a>, that includes full unicode support and targetted at the goal of out performing MFC and STL. The architecture, similarly to MFC's CStrings, is a copy on write reference counting mechanism.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Commercial</li>
<li>C++ only</li>
</ol>
<p>This library, like Vstr, uses a reference counting system. There is only so deeply I can analyze it, since I don't have a license for it. However, performance improvements over MFC's and STL, doesn't seem like a sufficient reason to move your source base to it. For example, in the future, Microsoft may improve the performance CString.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that performance testing of Bstrlib has indicated that its relative performance advantage versus MFC's CString and STL's <span class="tt">std::string</span> is at least as high as that for the Str library.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
libmib astrings</h1>
<p>This library provides <a href="http://www.mibsoftware.com/libmib/astring/">handful of functional extensions</a> to the C library that add dynamic string functionality.</p>
<p>This package basically references strings through <span class="tt">char **</span> pointers and assumes they are pointing to the top of an allocated heap entry (or <span class="tt">NULL</span>, in which case memory will be newly allocated from the heap). It is still up to user to mix and match the older C string functions with these functions whenever pointer arithmetic is used. There is no leveraging of the type system to assert semantic differences between references and base strings as Bstrlib does since no new types are introduced. Unlike Bstrlib, exact string length meta data is not stored, thus requiring a <span class="tt">strlen</span> call on <em>every</em> string writing operation. The library is very small, covering only a handful of C's functions.</p>
<p>While this is better than nothing, it is clearly slower than even the standard C library, less safe and less functional than Bstrlib.</p>
<p>To explain the advantage of using libmib, their website shows an example of how dangerous C code: </p><pre class="fragment">char buf[256];
char *pszExtraPath = ";/usr/local/bin";

strcpy(buf,getenv("PATH")); /* oops! could overrun! */
strcat(buf,pszExtraPath); /* Could overrun as well! */

printf("Checking...%s\n",buf); /* Some printfs overrun too! */
</pre><p>is avoided using libmib: </p><pre class="fragment">char *pasz = 0;      /* Must initialize to 0 */
char *paszOut = 0;
char *pszExtraPath = ";/usr/local/bin";

if (!astrcpy(&amp;pasz,getenv("PATH"))) /* malloc error */ exit(-1);
if (!astrcat(&amp;pasz,pszExtraPath)) /* malloc error */ exit(-1);

/* Finally, a "limitless" printf! we can use */
asprintf(&amp;paszOut,"Checking...%s\n",pasz);fputs(paszOut,stdout);

astrfree(&amp;pasz); /* Can use free(pasz) also. */
astrfree(&amp;paszOut);
</pre><p>However, compare this to Bstrlib: </p><pre class="fragment">bstring b, out;

bcatcstr (b = bfromcstr (getenv ("PATH")), ";/usr/local/bin");
out = bformat ("Checking...%s\n", bdatae (b, "&lt;Out of memory&gt;"));
/* if (out &amp;&amp; b) */ fputs (bdatae (out, "&lt;Out of memory&gt;"), stdout);
bdestroy (b);
bdestroy (out);
</pre><p>Besides being shorter, we can see that error handling can be deferred right to the very end. Also, unlike the above two versions, if <span class="tt">getenv</span> returns with <span class="tt">NULL</span>, the Bstrlib version will not exhibit undefined behavior. Initialization starts with the relevant content rather than an extra autoinitialization step.</p>

<li>Uses standard <span class="tt">char *</span> buffer, and adopts C 99's usage of <span class="tt">restrict</span> to pass the responsibility to guard against aliasing to the programmer.</li>
<li>Mixes <span class="tt">char *</span> and length wrapped buffers (estr) functions, doubling the API size, with safety limited to only half of the functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Firestring was originally just a wrapper of <span class="tt">char *</span> functionality with extra length parameters. However, it has been augmented with the inclusion of the estr type which has similar functionality to <span class="tt">stralloc</span>. But fireString does not nearly cover the functional scope of Bstrlib.</p>

Safe C String Library</h1>
<p>A <a href="http://www.zork.org/safestr/safestr.html">library</a> written for the purpose of increasing safety and power to C's string handling capabilities.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>While the <span class="tt">safestr_*</span> functions are safe in of themselves, interoperating with <span class="tt">char *</span> string has dangerous unsafe modes of operation.</li>
<li>The architecture of safestr's causes the base pointer to change. Thus, its not practical/safe to store a safestr in multiple locations if any single instance can be manipulated.</li>
<li>Dependent on an additional error handling library.</li>
<li>Uses reference counting, meaning that it is either not thread safe or slow and not portable.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the idea of reallocating (and hence potentially changing) the base pointer is a serious design flaw that is fatal to this architecture. True safety is obtained by having automatic handling of all common scenarios without creating implicit constraints on the user.</p>
<p>Because of its automatic temporary clean up system, it cannot use "const" semantics on input arguments. Interesting anomolies such as: </p><pre class="fragment">safestr_t s, t;
s = safestr_replace (t = SAFESTR_TEMP ("This is a test"),
                     SAFESTR_TEMP (" "), SAFESTR_TEMP ("."));
/* t is now undefined. */
</pre><p>are possible. If one defines a function which takes a <span class="tt">safestr_t</span> as a parameter, then the function would not know whether or not the <span class="tt">safestr_t</span> is defined after it passes it to a safestr library function. The author recommended method for working around this problem is to examine the attributes of the <span class="tt">safestr_t</span> within the function which is to modify any of its parameters and play games with its reference count. I think, therefore, that the whole <span class="tt">SAFESTR_TEMP</span> idea is also fatally broken.</p>
<p>The library implements immutability, optional non-resizability, and a "trust" flag. This trust flag is interesting, and suggests that applying any arbitrary sequence of <span class="tt">safestr_*</span> function calls on any set of trusted strings will result in a trusted string. It seems to me, however, that if one wanted to implement a trusted string semantic, one might do so by actually creating a different <em>type</em> and only implement the subset of string functions that are deemed safe (i.e., user input would be excluded, for example). This, in essence, would allow the compiler to enforce trust propogation at compile time rather than run time. Non-resizability is also interesting, however, it seems marginal, i.e., to want a string that cannot be resized, yet can be modified and yet where a fixed sized buffer is undesirable.</p>

Libsrt</h1>
<p>This is a length based string library based on a slightly different strategy. The string contents are appended to the end of the header directly so strings only require a single allocation. However, whenever a reallocation occurs, the header is replicated and the base pointer for the string is changed. That means references to the string are only valid so long as they are not resized after any such reference is cached. The internal structure maintains a lot some state used to accelerate unicode manipulation. This state is dynamically updated according to usage (so, like Bstrlib, it supports both a binary mode and a Unicode mode basically all the time). But this makes sustainable usage of the library essentially opaque. This also creates a bottleneck for whatever extensions to the library one desires (write all extensions on top of the base library, put in a request to the author, or dedicate an expert to learn the internals of the library).</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md14"></a>
SDS</h1>
<p>Sds uses a strategy very similar to Libsrt. However, it uses some dynamic headers to decrease the overhead for very small strings. This requires an extra switch statement for access to each string attribute. The source code appears to use gcc/clang extensions, and thus it is not portable. </p>
